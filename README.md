How to Install

Download Forge 1.8.9 (https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/)
Launch Forge
Download ChatTriggers (https://www.chattriggers.com/)
Download Source Code.
Unzip it.
Drag the Source code (the DungeonPartyUtils folder) into the modules folder. (Appdata/Roaming/.minecraft/config/ChatTriggers/modules)

The mod won't work without an api key so make sure to run /api new or set a key with /dpu key {key}. For all commands just run /dpu
(To clear any confusion the commands add, remove and list are talking about which items the mod checks for in a player's inventory.)
